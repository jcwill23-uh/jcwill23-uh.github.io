title: "Swan River Group Project"
excerpt: "In this project, I was a part of building a web app that has RBAC. We used Office365 for authentication. Basic users are able to fill out form information and then it is submitted to admins for review. A hierarchy system is in place for admins that allows for delegation of forms to lower level admins to review.<br/>
