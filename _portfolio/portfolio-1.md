title: "Swan River Group Project"
excerpt: "In this project, I was a part of building a web app that has RBAC. We used Office365 for authentication. Basic users are able to fill out form information and then it is submitted to admins for review. A hierarchy system is in place for admins that allows for delegation of forms to lower level admins to review. Managers can be set by top tier admins which gives them the ability to delegate forms for review to their team members. Admins also have the ability to manage user's profile information and restrict access.<br/>
